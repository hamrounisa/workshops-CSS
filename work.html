            <h2>Internet of Things (IOT)</h2>
        <p>
            The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

        <h2>Can IoT work without the Internet?</h2>
    <!--definition of quation can i work without internet-->
    <article>By their very nature, IoT devices work in tandem with other devices. Most IoT devices need a connection to function to their full potential by connecting to other IoT devices, however many will have limited functionality without access to the Internet. For example, an Alexa won’t play music without a connection to the Internet, but it will still allow you to set timers and alarms.
